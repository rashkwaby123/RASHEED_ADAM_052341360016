        All students admitted to hospitals following Monday’s clash between protesting students 
        of Islamic Senior High School and the Police in Kumasi have been discharged.

        22 of them were treated and discharged on Monday while the remaining 17 students
         were equally discharged on Tuesday and have reunited with their colleagues on campus.

        The Ashanti Regional Minister, Simon Osei Mensah disclosed this when he addressed the students.


        He reiterated the earlier assurance given by the Inspector General of Police, Dr. Akuffo Dampare
        that the speed ramps will be constructed on the roads.

        The Ashanti Regional Director of the Ghana Education Service, Madam Mary Afriyie commended 
        the student for their cooperation after the unfortunate incident.

        <h3><u>Background</u></h3>

        The Deputy Ashanti Regional Police Commander has been removed from his position while
        two other senior officers have also been interdicted 
        following initial police probe into the chaos at the Islamic Senior High School in Kumasi on Monday.

        A police statement said the conduct of officers who responded to the protest by the 
        students fell short of the professional police conduct on crowd control.


        About twenty students were hospitalised after police fired pepper spray and warning
        shorts to disperse the crowd of students who had blocked the road during the protest.

        Students and Police officers who were injured in the process have been treated and discharged.

        Meanwhile, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Dr. George Akuffo Dampare, has assured
        students of Islamic Senior High School in Kumasi that his outfit will do all it can to protect them.

        “Each and every one of you has been brought to this world to achieve a particular purpose 
        for which no other person can accomplish it. Therefore we have a responsibility to ensure 
        that all of you are safe and live to your full potential so as for you to be able to distinguish
        yourself and your God giving destiny for this generation and general unborn.

        “Therefore, anything that will take you out of this world before the accomplishment
        of your destiny is something that is ungodly and we will do whatever it takes to 
        ensure that it doesn’t happen,” Dr. Dampare assured the students.

            An English tutor at the Islamic Senior High School (SHS) in the Ashanti Region, 
            Kofi Antwi, is seeking justice for what he alleged was police brutality meted out
            to him in the Islamic SHS and police clash. 

            He currently cannot see as his head and face has been bandaged as a result of the 
            assault meted out to him in the  melee that ensued last Monday was battered by crowd-control 
            Police until he fell and even denied access to the hospital. 

            Narrating his ordeal to the media as the Defence and Interior Committee 
            of Parliament visited the school on a fact-finding mission on Friday to
            ascertain what led to the fracas, the tutor who now walks with assistance 
            said all he set out from home that day to do was to teach. 

            “I was coming to teach because I had classes in the morning. So when I 
            got to the entrance, I realised the students were on the street. I inquired
            and was told they were demonstrating to demand for speed ramps due to the
            incessant knockdown of colleagues. 

            “So I stood there and said they have a genuine concern. That’s
            all I said and the police claimed I incited them to pour on the streets.
            They (police) used the butt of their guns to hit me several times before 
            dragging me to the police station,” Mr Antwi recounted. 

            With a white bandage wrapped around his head and covering both eyes, 
            he questioned why authorities had to wait for students to demonstrate
            over erection of speed ramps after several appeals to the department of Urban Roads. 

            “Students should not have to be on the street before things are done
            right. I am not happy the demonstration came off but the students were 
            justified, though bleeding from the brutalities of the armed policemen,
            my prayer to them was to take me to the hospital yielded no result. 

            “When we were even going to the police station, I was telling them that 
            I was severely wounded because of the bruises, but they never took me 
            serious, though treated and discharged, the effect of the manhandling
            by the police has left him in pains. I feel severe headache, pains in
            both eyes and body and as you can see, I cannot walk without assistance
            and I do not know when they will heal.
